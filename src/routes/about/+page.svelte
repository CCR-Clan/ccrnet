		CCR is an application only closed Clan. CCR is not only a clan, but a community for those to interact, play games, and have fun. While we encorage members to climb the ranks, we have
plenty of casual gamers and even some people who don't game at all.  Our name has been seen across <u><a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a></u> for a while, maybe you have seen it? We play games such as 
Fortnite, Minecraft, Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, and other great games. CCR members are forever strong as one, but they can build their path together.  What does CCR stand for? I guess you'll never know.
